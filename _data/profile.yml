    Currently, I work as an AI Algorithm Engineer Intern at Huawei Technologies, where I contribute to the development of AI4Coding tools. I also serve as a Research Assistant at CUHK-Shenzhen, collaborating with Tencent Ads on optimal boost design for auto-bidding mechanisms. My research has been submitted and published in top-tier conferences including AAAI and ICIC.
